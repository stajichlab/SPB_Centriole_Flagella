These are proteins taken from Fritz-Laylin et al. 2010 "The Genome of Naegleria gruberi Illuminates Early Eukaryotic Versatility" (doi:10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.032)[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2010.01.032]
 - the supplementary file is a PDF so it was hard to download these proteins easily
 - a subset of proteins were not in the JGI download but were available on the website as there was some user-curated gene models/names
   that are available through the JGI portal but not in the download folder. http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/pages/search-for-genes.jsf?organism=Naegr1 http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Naegr1/Naegr1.home.html
